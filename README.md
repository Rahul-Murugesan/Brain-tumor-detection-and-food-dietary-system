Integrated Deep Learning Pipeline for Brain Tumor  Detection and Personalized Dietary Recommendations 
Objective 
Develop an integrated system comprising three machine learning models to: 
1. Detect brain tumors from MRI scans. 
2. Assess the severity and clinical implications based on detection results and patient data. 
3. Provide personalized dietary recommendations tailored to the patient's condition. 
 
 
 # Model 1: Brain Tumor Detection from MRI Scans 
Purpose 
Automatically identify the presence of brain tumors in MRI images with a confidence score. 
Model Architecture 
• Type: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
• Architecture: EfficientNetB2, fine-tuned on brain MRI datasets 
• Input: Preprocessed brain MRI images 
• Output: Binary classification (Tumor / No Tumor) with confidence level  
Data Flow 
1. Input: Raw MRI images 
2. Preprocessing: 
o Image normalization 
o Resizing to match model input dimensions 
o Noise reduction techniques 
3. Model Inference: CNN processes the image to detect tumor presence 
4. Output: Detection result with associated confidence score. 
 
 
 
 
 
# Model 2: Clinical Severity Assessment 
Purpose 
Evaluate the severity of the detected tumor by integrating imaging results with clinical data. 
Model Architecture 
• Type: Gradient Boosting Machine 
• Algorithm: XGBoost 
• Input: 
o Output from Model 1 (e.g., tumor presence, confidence score) 
o Patient clinical data (e.g., age, symptoms, medical history) 
• Output: Severity classification (e.g., Low, Medium, High)  
Data Flow 
1. Input: Model 1 results and patient clinical data 
2. Preprocessing: 
o Handling missing values 
o Encoding categorical variables 
o Feature scaling 
3. Model Inference: XGBoost predicts severity level 
4. Output: Severity classification 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
# Model 3: Personalized Dietary Recommendation 
Purpose 
Suggest dietary plans tailored to the patient's condition and severity level. 
Model Architecture 
• Type: Gradient Boosting Machine 
• Algorithm: XGBoost 
• Input: 
o Severity classification from Model 2 
o Patient dietary preferences and restrictions 
• Output: Personalized dietary recommendations 
Data Flow 
1. Input: Severity level and patient dietary information 
2. Preprocessing: 
o Encoding dietary preferences 
o Mapping severity levels to dietary needs 
3. Model Inference: XGBoost generates dietary recommendations 
4. Output: Customized diet plan  
 
 
 
 
# Summary 
Integrated Deep Learning Pipeline for Brain Tumor Detection and Personalized Dietary Recommendations 
efficiently processes MRI images to detect brain tumors, assesses the severity by combining imaging and clinical 
data, and provides personalized dietary recommendations. The use of CNN for image analysis and XGBoost for 
structured data ensures high accuracy and performance across the stages.
